ðŸ“Š Descriptive and Inferential Statistics Mini Project

ðŸ’¾ Project Description

This project provides a structured, hands-on introduction to Descriptive and Inferential Statistics. It is designed for students, beginners in data science, or anyone seeking to build a solid foundation in statistical analysis. The project walks through core concepts using manual calculations and real-world context to ensure a deeper understanding of both theory and application.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

The main goals of this project are:

To understand essential statistical terminology and concepts.

To manually compute key statistical measures like mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and interquartile range.

To explore data types and measurement levels.

To apply inferential methods such as confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.

To develop critical skills in interpreting data and drawing conclusions.

ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

This project covers a wide range of foundational topics in statistics, including:

Key definitions such as population, sample, parameter, and statistic

Measures of central tendency: mean, median, and mode

Manual calculation of statistical metrics

Types of data and levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio

Theoretical understanding of variance and standard deviation

Computation of range and interquartile range (IQR)

Five-number summary and understanding boxplots

Confidence interval estimation for population parameters

One-sample Z-tests for hypothesis testing

ðŸ“ˆ Dataset

Synthetic Dataset: Simple numeric data created specifically for practicing statistical computations manually and verifying concepts.

ðŸ›  Tools, Technologies, and Packages

Technologies:

Markdown (for documentation)

Git & GitHub (for version control and collaboration)

Python (optional, for validation)

Excel or Google Sheets (optional, for manual calculations)

Python Packages (if used):

numpy â€“ For numerical operations and statistical functions

scipy.stats â€“ For hypothesis testing and confidence intervals

pandas â€“ For organizing and manipulating data (optional)

Skills Developed:

Understanding types of data and scales of measurement

Manual and programmatic computation of statistical metrics

Interpreting measures of central tendency and dispersion

Constructing and interpreting confidence intervals

Performing and evaluating hypothesis tests

Documentation and reproducibility using markdown and GitHub

This project emphasizes manual computation first to reinforce learning before automating with code.

âœ… Expected Outcomes

By completing this project, you will be able to:

Understand the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics

Accurately calculate and interpret central tendency and dispersion measures

Construct confidence intervals to estimate population parameters

Perform and interpret hypothesis tests using real-world scenarios

Make informed, data-driven decisions based on statistical evidence
